# OData CGI endpoint

This is a [CGI Script](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3875) that
provides an [OData](http://www.odata.org/) Atom endpoint to
OData consumers (such as Tableau).

The CGI script is intended to be used within the ScraperWiki.com
platform. Typically the URL that is accessed in generated by the
[OData tool](https://github.com/scraperwiki/odata-tool/), but it
could be generated by hand, or some other program.
